* We believe B-tree is more appropriate for indexing spatial data, since B-tree is an efficient ordered key-value map, which means that B-tree index can quickly find a record given the key. But R-tree is an 'spatial index' that it can quickly identify 'close' values in 2 or more dimensions. Also R tree can be thought of as generalization of a b-tree, since we are interested in the range of x and y, B-tree is more suitable rather than r-tree where is tree data structures used for indexing multi-dimensional informations.

Looking at the average execution time for btree and rtree from the above table we can see that the rtree is clearly faster on average and much more efficient.

R-tree are tree data structures used for spatial access methods, for indexing multi- dimensional information such as geographical coordinates, rectangles or polygons.


hence in our situation it is easy for r tree to group by near values and create an MBR wheras BTree is an efficient ordered key-value map. that means that a BTREE index can quickly find a record given the key, and it can be scanned in order. It also makes easy to fetch all keys (and records) within a range since rtree will more efficiently and easily search for values and MBR because it has the ability to more easily search for points near it and hence has a better advantage and is more efficient to index this data and is more appropriate
