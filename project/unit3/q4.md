* We believe B-tree is more appropriate for indexing spatial data, since B-tree is an efficient ordered key-value map, which means that B-tree index can quickly find a record given the key. But R-tree is an 'spatial index' that it can quickly identify 'close' values in 2 or more dimensions. Also R tree can be thought of as generalization of a b-tree, since we are interested in the range of x and y, B-tree is more suitable rather than r-tree where is tree data structures used for indexing multi-dimensional informations.
